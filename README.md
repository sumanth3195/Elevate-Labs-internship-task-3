🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression.

Task 3 – Elevate Labs AI/ML Internship.

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple and Multiple Linear Regression models using the Housing Price Prediction dataset. The goal is to predict house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.


📌 Objective

Understand and implement linear regression from scratch using Scikit-learn.

Perform data preprocessing and EDA.

Train and evaluate a regression model using MAE, MSE, and R².

Visualize predictions and interpret model performance.
